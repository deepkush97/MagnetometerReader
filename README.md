# MagnetometerReader
Cross- Language Cross- Platform Socket Programming Example

This app is made for reading the magnetometer reading from the android phone and then transmit that reading to the provided IP Address and Port Address.
It uses the cross-platform socket connection. The android phone is provided as the client of the socket. And it can be connected from any socket program, the IP address and Port Address of the server side should be provided in the android app and it will transmit the magnetometer reading to that server.


It was actually made for my friend's project. He wanted to get his phone's magnetometer reading to his server so that he can do his machine learning things using that ;)
